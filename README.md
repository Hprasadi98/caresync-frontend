Sri Lanka achieves relatively high social and health development in comparison with countries of similar levels of economic development. Around 1103 government and 141 privately funded hospitals in Sri Lanka are currently in service[1].  
In modern society mobile and web applications have emerged as transformative tools that can effectively address the challenges of the medical industry, especially focusing on patient-doctor communication. The solutions involving mobile and web applications to improve patient-doctor communication are characterized by technological innovation and a patient-centered approach. 
Patients and doctors always wanted to increase efficiency and accuracy in their medical communications to work together to establish treatment goals, monitor progress, and adjust plans as needed. The solutions involve a technological revolution in healthcare communication with a strong focus on patient empowerment and efficient information exchange with patients and doctors.



Usage

CareSync project aims to digitize the traditional communication between doctors and patients. The System will be implemented with a heavy focus on security and transparency,
as security is a crucial factor in medical applications. Encryption and industry-standard security protocols will be used to protect the private medical information of the patients.
Furthermore, the system will manage user authentication, authenticate access to user data to relevant parties approved by the user, and provide secure, encrypted data storage for 
the patient's medical records.
